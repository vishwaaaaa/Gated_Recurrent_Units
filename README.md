This folder has the code and the folder structure used for generating results for the EECS545 final project.
This implementation is done by using the code from 
```@article{prasanna2023using,
  title={Using Deep Learning Models to Predict Prosthetic Ankle Torque},
  author={Prasanna, Christopher and Realmuto, Jonathan and Anderson, Anthony and Rombokas, Eric and Klute, Glenn},
  journal={Sensors},
  volume={23},
  number={18},
  pages={7712},
  year={2023},
  publisher={MDPI}
}
```
It has the pickledata_plot.py that is the data pipeline.


The main run script is under scripts folder and the additional functions are under src


The trained models came we found at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ISvRuulaC4SvnOXtBewYF9wbGL7fwXER?usp=sharing
The code should be executed from RoboKnee_Ankle_DeepLearning folder
